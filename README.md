Dataset used : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/victorsoeiro/netflix-tv-shows-and-movies?select=titles.csv

**Business Problem:**
Netflix is looking to gather useful insights from their shows and movies dataset to enhance the subscriber experience. However, with around 82k rows of data, they face challenges in effectively analyzing this large dataset and uncovering meaningful patterns and trends.

**Solution Approach:**
To help Netflix analyze and extract valuable insights, I will use SQL to query and process the dataset efficiently. By leveraging SQL functions, I will extract key metrics such as viewer ratings, popularity trends, genre preferences, and viewership patterns. This data will then be presented in a clear and understandable manner, allowing Netflix to uncover actionable insights from their shows and movies. This solution will help Netflix make data-driven decisions by highlighting trends that matter to their subscribers.
